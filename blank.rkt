#lang racket

; just gonna use this as a template for all the machines.

; create an initial state around a closed expression
(define (inj-cesk e) '())
; move the machine 1 step from a given state.
(define (step-cesk exp env store cont) '())
; evaluate from an initial state
(define (evaluate e) '())
